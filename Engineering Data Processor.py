Exercise 1: Engineering Data Processor (Reinforcement)
Write a program that processes electrical measurement data:
measurements = [220.5, 225.2, 218.9, 230.1, 215.6, 228.3, 222.7]
Your program should:

Use a while loop to find the first voltage reading above 225V
Use a for loop to calculate the average voltage
Use conditional logic to count how many readings are within Â±5% of 220V
Print all results with proper labels

This reinforces: loops, conditionals, variables, basic math operations
